# knn-based-reconstructions
Python code for reconstructions of dust plumes basd on k nearest neighbours. The code was developed and tested on a machine running with Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS. For background, please refer to the manuscript.

`dust_layer_reconstruction_knn.py` contains an implementation based on scikit-learn.
`custom_knn_ellipsic_distance.py` contains a custom knn-implementation with an alternative distance metric.
